#Scala photo deduplicator
## Find duplicates of your photos and list them in a csv based on Lire (https://github.com/dermotte/LIRE)
###Each run finds only first duplicate. If you have multiple duplicates, run the code multiple times,omitting the indexing function. 
Why? Cuz I ain't got time to fix it

How to use? -> Put in your folder path and let it rip


This was built as my first, test Scala project. Maybe it will be upgraded in the future. Maybe now. I give no guarantees about anything from this code.
